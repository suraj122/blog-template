                Apollo Isha Vidhya Niketan was perplexed about how the young
                rural school pupils could jot down their first flight stories
                without having ever really traveled by air. Having known about
                the little daydreamers, Airytails gave a chance for the rural
                school pupils to participate in the contest – the rural school
                pupils could use their imagination to create their own first
                flight stories. And thus the rural school pupils began their
                first imaginary take off! Four of them flew to places like
                Tokyo, Kathmandu, Bengaluru. They soared in their own dreams and
                landed down with their own imaginary stories. The original
                make-believe stories of four pupils were submitted successfully
                on December 17, 2018.

                “I flew for the first time by Emirates plane to Tokyo. It was an
                exciting trip. When I entered the plane, the air-hostess greeted
                me with a beautiful smile. I got the window seat. After some
                time, the flight took off, it was a breathtaking moment! In no
                time, the flight was in the air and I was in cloud nine, I was
                really flying!”
              </p>
              <p class="post-text">
                “Having snacks at home and in school has been quite common in my
                life, but having snacks in air, ah, that was lovely!”
              </p>
              <p class="post-text">
                “I watched movies on the plane, I read books on the plane. I
                waited eagerly for the landing. The time came for me to see the
                landing. Ah, I reached Tokyo! My first flight experience was
                amazing!!”

                “My father took us on a trip to Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal.
                We went by air. It was the first time that I had seen an
                aeroplane. I was really excited to enter it. I got the window
                seat which gave me a view of the outside world.”
              </p>
              <p class="post-text">
                “The pilot started the engine which gave out a loud roar and
                began to fly higher and higher. I looked through the window and
                enjoyed the view of the city. The people looked like dots and
                buildings like toys. I was filled with joy and I was thrilled.”

                The moment of seeing the #Winner Alert! on WhatsApp is
                unforgettable to all of our four young writers. It was
                exhilarating to read the Airytails CEO and Founder, J S Ashwini
                ’s statement on Facebook: “We couldn’t stop ourselves from
                choosing these 4 kids from Isha Vidhya Chittor as winners for
                our #firstflight contest. I’m sure everyone would agree after
                reading their amazing imagination for how #firstflight would
                be?” The applause for our school pupils on Facebook is
                overwhelming, indeed. Airytails felt to give more to our humble
                young pupils.
              </p>
              <h2 class="post-heading">Giving More</h2>
              <p class="post-text">
                For the first time, Airytails collaborated with Sanahi Studio,
                Bengaluru and made an amazing painting. On February 05, 2019,
                Airytails visited Apollo Isha Vidhya Niketan – Aragonda to give
                away the painting and to congratulate the four winners of the
                #firstflight contest. The four pupils were ecstatic to receive
                the winner’s certificates from Airytails.

                Besides, they were pampered with a few sheets of paper planes.
              </p>
              <p class="post-text">
                Before leaving our school, Airytails generously gave away the
                sheets of paper planes to the enthusiastic students and also
                helped the students make paper planes. Both the Airytails team
                and Apollo Isha Vidhya Niketan students enjoyed themselves in
                making the paper planes and flying them the farthest, of course!

              <p class="post-text">
                The whole school was awed at the enthusiasm of the Airytails –
                the enthusiasm to kindle the minds of the young pupils to dream
                to fly!
